OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
This is a set of KBase client libraries that provides basic authentication objects: authentication tokens and user profiles

These libraries do not directly access any KBase web service APIs, but they are used to acquire/validate tokens
and fetch user profile objects whenever authenticated access is needed. These libraries are called by the main
KBase web service APIs, and can also be used when making requests against KBase services that support OAuth
tokens.
Technical documentation is in the form of perldocs embedded in the Bio::KBase::AuthToken and Bio::KBase::AuthUser
modules - sample code is included in the docs. A "make deploy-docs" should install the docs in the appropriate
directories.
