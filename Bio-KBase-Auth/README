Bio-KBase-Auth

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.


INSTALLATION

NOTE FOR MACOS LION AND HIGHER

Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 (v1.800.2 as of this writing) does not appear to install in
MacOS X 10.7 or higher. A few hacks to the makefile seem to resolve it.

Download the module from CPAN, then edit Makefile.PL. Change:

cc_optimize_flags('-O2 -g -Wall -Werror');
to
cc_optimize_flags('-O2 -g');

Then, in the generated Makefile, remove clang flags for -arch ppc -arch ppc64.

You can then proceed with make, make install as normal. It will throw a lot of errors now
but it's the best we can do.

Mountain Lion users may need to upgrade OpenSSL as well, and edit the Makefile.PL to point
to the appropriate newly installed library.
